# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# b = Student.create!("first_name": 'b', "last_name": 'c', "active": false)
# a = Student.create!("first_name": 'a', "last_name": 'b', "active": false)
